## Lecture Notes (Spring 2026)

Most of the notes are in [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). [See here
for an overview](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AllenDowney/ThinkPython/blob/v3/chapters/jupyter_intro.ipynb) if you are unfamiliar with notebooks.

**You don't need to install notebook software on your own computer**. They are
easy to read on the web in a couple of ways:

1. **Directly through their github web links.** Just click on the Github link,
   e.g. [chapter
   0](https://github.com/tjd1234/cmpt120spring2026/blob/main/textbook/chap00.ipynb).
2. **Using the [Jupyter notebook viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).** Paste
   the github link into the viewer.
3. **Use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).** You will need a
   (free) Google account to use it. You can open notebooks interactively in
   [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). You can also save your
   own copies in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) that you can run
   and edit. [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) provides all the Python
   libraries you are likely to ever need, and you can run cells online in your web browser.
