Instead, we usually\n","pick a **key operation** and count how many times it is performed. A well-chosen\n","key operation will give us a good idea of how fast the algorithm is, and how it\n","scales as the size of the input grows.\n","\n","For linear search, a good key operation is the comparison operator `==`. For\n","example:\n","\n","- At *best*, `==` is called 1 time.\n","  - This occurs when $x$ is the first item, or if there's only one item in the\n","    list.\n","- At *worst*, `==` is called $n$ times. \n","  - This occurs when $x$ is not in the list, or when $x$ is the last item of the\n","    list.\n","- On *average*, `==` is called about $\\frac{n}{2}$ times.\n","  - This assumes that $x$ is equally likely to be anywhere in the list.\n","\n","So, just by looking at the algorithm, we can infer that linear search calls `==`\n","from 0 to $n$ times. \n","\n","The **worst case performance** of linear search is to call `==` $n$ times.
