# binary_search_exercises_sol.py

#
# Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the index of a target value in
# a list that is in sorted order. It works much faster than linear search.
#
# A list of strings is in sorted if they are in alphabetical order, e.g.:
#
#   in sorted order: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana", "Eve"] 
#   in sorted order: ["Bob"] 
#   in sorted order: []
#
#   not in sorted order: ["Charlie", "Diana", "Eve", "Alice", "Bob"] 
#   not in sorted order: ["Eve", "Alice"]
#
# A list of numbers is in sorted order if they are in order from smallest to
# largest, e.g.:
#
#   in sorted order: [4, 10, 14, 15]
#   in sorted order: [5] 
#   in sorted order: []
#
#   not in sorted order: [4, 14, 10, 15]
#   not in sorted order: [5, 1]

# TODO 1 Create a new variable called names initialized to this sorted list of
# strings: "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana", "Eve". Print it to make sure it
# is correct.
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana", "Eve"] 

# TODO 2 Print the length of names using the len() function.
print('length:', names)

# TODO 3 Print the first and last names, and also print the the list in reverse
# alphabetical order.
print('first and last:', names[0], names[-1])
print('reverse:', names[::-1])

#
# The middle index
#

# TODO 4 Binary search works by checking the middle element of a list. What are
# the middle elements of names? What is the middle element of scores?
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana", "Eve"]
scores = [4, 10, 14, 15]

print('middle of names:', names[2]) # Charlie
print('middle of scores:', scores[2]) # 14

# TODO 5 Suppose L is a list of length n, with its elements in sorted order.
# What is the general formula, using n, for the middle element of L? Use this
# formula to print the middle element of names and scores. Hint: Recall that a
# // b is integer division.

# The middle element of L is L[n // 2]

print('middle of names:', names[len(names) // 2]) # Charlie
print('middle of scores:', scores[len(scores) // 2]) # 14


# TODO 6 After binary search finds the middle element, it checks to see if the
# target value is equal to the middle element, less than the middle element, or
# greater than the middle element. Using the target and list given, write an
# if-elif-else statement that compares the target to the middle element and
# print whether it is equal to it, less than it, or greater than it.
#
# Test it with targets "Charlie", "Allie", and "Zara".

# TODO 7 Re-do the previous task, but this time change elif and else parts to
# print the slice of the list where the target might be. Specifically:
# - if target is less than middle element, print the slice from 0 up to, but not 
#   including, mid
# - if target is greater than middle element, print the slice of the list from
#   mid + 1 to to the end

# A test program
#

# TODO 13 Write a test program for binary_search. The program should read a word
# typed by the user, search for it in a sorted list of names, and print whether
# the word was found or not. If the user types 'done', print 'bye bye!' and stop
# the program.
#
# For example:
#
#   --> Alice 
#   found it!
#   --> Zara 
#   NOT found
#   --> Charlie 
#   found it!
#   --> done 
#   bye bye!
#
# Here is pseudocode for the program:
# - set names to ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana", "Eve"] 
# - using input, read a word from the user
# - while the word read from the user is not "done", do the following:
#   - call binary_search to search for the word in names
#   - if the word is found, print "<word> found"
#   - otherwise, print "<word> NOT found"
#   - read a new word from the user
# - print "bye bye!"

names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana", "Eve"]
